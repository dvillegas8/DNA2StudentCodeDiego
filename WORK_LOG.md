| October 9  | 9:20 - 10:00 |                                                                                                                                                                                      Wrote code to attempt doing this problem iteratively. |
| October 9  | 6:50 - 8:00  | Finished writing the code, fixed bugs because it was going on an infinite loop. My code works for the first two cases, however it takes forever for the Chromosome22. Therefore, the next step is to find how to do this more efficiently. |
| October 10 | 2:00 - 3:00  |                                                                                                                                                              Working on an algorithm where you do comparisons between ints and not strings |
| October 14 | 6:40 - 7:00  |                                                                                                                                                Finished the new algorithm but the problem is that I am not getting an out of bounds error. |
